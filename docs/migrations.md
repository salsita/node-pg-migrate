# Defining Migrations

When you run `node-pg-migrate create` a new migration file is created that looks like this:

```javascript
exports.shorthands = undefined;

exports.up = function up(pgm) {};

exports.down = function down(pgm) {};
```

`pgm` is a helper object that provides migration operations and `run` is the callback to call when you are done.

`shorthands` is optional for column type shorthands. You can specify custom types which will be expanded to column definition
(e.g. for `exports.shorthands = { id: { type: 'uuid', primaryKey: true }, createdAt: { type: 'timestamp', notNull: true, default: new PgLiteral('current_timestamp') } };`
it will in `pgm.createTable('test', { id: 'id', createdAt: 'createdAt' });` produce SQL `CREATE TABLE "test" ("id" uuid PRIMARY KEY, "createdAt" timestamp DEFAULT current_timestamp NOT NULL);`).
These shorthands are inherited from previous migrations. You can override/change value by simply defining new value for given shorthand name,
if will be used in current and all following migrations (until changed again).

**IMPORTANT**
Calling the migration functions on `pgm` doesn't actually migrate your database. These functions just add sql commands to a stack that is run.

### Automatic Down Migrations

If `exports.down` is not present in a migration, node-pg-migrate will try to automatically infer the operations that make up the down migration by reversing the operations of the up migration. Only some operations have automatically inferrable equivalents (details below on each operation). Sometimes, migrations are destructive and cannot be rolled back. In this case, you can set `exports.down = false` to tell node-pg-migrate that the down migration is impossible.

### Async Migrations

In some cases, you may want to perform some async operation during a migration, for example fetching some information from an external server, or inserting some data into the database. To make a migration block operate in async mode, just add another callback argument to the function signature. However, be aware that NONE of the pgm operations will be executed until `run()` is called. Here's an example:

```javascript
exports.up = function up(pgm, run) {
  doSomethingAsync(function () {
    run();
  });
};
```

Another way how to perform some async operation is to return [Promise](https://promisesaplus.com/) from `up` or `down` function. Example:

```javascript
exports.up = function (pgm) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    // doSomethingAsync
    resolve();
  });
};
```

or

```javascript
exports.up = async (pgm) => {
  // doSomethingAsync
};
```

### Using schemas

Instead of passing string as name to `pgm` functions, you can pass an object with keys `schema` and `name`. E.g.

`pgm.createTable({ schema: 'my_schema', name: 'my_table_name' }, { id: 'serial' });`

will generate

```sql
CREATE TABLE "my_schema"."my_table_name" (
 "id" serial
);
```

#### Type

```ts
type Name = string | { schema: string; name: string };
```

### Locking

`node-pg-migrate` automatically checks if no other migration is running. To do so, it uses an
[advisory lock](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/explicit-locking.html#id-1.5.12.6.9.2)
(see [#239](https://github.com/salsita/node-pg-migrate/pull/239)).
Lock is held for duration of DB session, so if migration scripts hangs up, you need to kill it,
before running another migration script.

## Migration methods

The `pgm` object that is passed to each up/down block has many different operations available. Each operation is simply a function that generates some sql and stores it in the current pgm context.

By default, all migrations will be run in a transaction. To disable transactions for a specific migration, call `pgm.noTransaction()`
This is required for some SQL operations that cannot be run within a transaction. It should be used carefully.
