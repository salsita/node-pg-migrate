# Programmatic API

Alongside command line, you can use `node-pg-migrate` also programmatically. It exports runner function,
which takes options argument with the following structure (similar to [command line arguments](cli.md#configuration)):

## Options

> [!NOTE]
> If you use `dbClient`, you should not use `databaseUrl` at the same time and vice versa.
